## 📈 Data Quality Metrics

The pipeline generates a quality report at the end of each execution, visible in the logs. The following metrics are calculated to ensure insight reliability:

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ID Completeness** | % of records with non-null `patient_id` and `doctor_id`. | < 100% (Critical Error) |
| **Referential Integrity** | % of appointments whose `doctor_id` exists in the master table. | < 95% (Warning) |
| **Duplicate Rate** | Number of rows removed due to being identical. | > 5% (Check source) |
| **Typing Success** | % of dates (`booking_date`) successfully converted to DateTime. | < 100% (Format Error) |

---

## 🛠️ Error Handling and Exceptions

The system is designed to be **fail-safe**, documenting every anomaly without compromising the entire process:

### 1. Critical Errors (Pipeline Stops)

* **Connection Failure:** If the PostgreSQL container is inactive, the script stops and raises a `ConnectionError`.
* **Corrupted Files:** If Excel files cannot be read by Pandas, the process terminates to prevent partial data loading.
* **Invalid Schema:** If mandatory columns (`id`, `status`) are missing, the pipeline aborts.

### 2. Non-Critical Errors (Filter & Log)

To maintain business continuity, certain errors only discard the affected row:

* **Orphaned `Doctor ID`:** If an appointment belongs to a doctor not found in `doctors.xlsx`, the appointment is moved to an audit log and is not loaded into the DB to maintain referential integrity.
* **Invalid Date Format:** If a date cannot be parsed, the record is discarded, and the row ID is reported in the log.
* **Unknown Status:** Unmapped statuses are normalized to `unknown` rather than failing, allowing for later analysis of anomalous data.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8+**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required to run the PostgreSQL database locally. [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* **Make**: Utility for automating commands (preinstalled on Linux/Mac; on Windows, use WSL or Git Bash).

### Virtual Environment Setup (venv)

It is **mandatory** to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with the global Python installation.


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jeanpaulrestedur1234/ETLDataEngineer.git

cd ETLDataEngineer

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Setup Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies and start DB
make install
make up

```



## 📂 Input Data

Place the input files inside the following directory:

```text
data/raw/doctors.xlsx
data/raw/appointments.xlsx
```

All raw data files must be located in:

```text
data/raw/
```


---


### 2. Execution

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline
make run


```

---

## ⚡ Available Commands (Makefile)

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make install` | Installs Python dependencies |
| `make up` | Starts the PostgreSQL container |
| `make down` | Stops the PostgreSQL container |
| `make etl` | Runs only the ETL process |
| `make queries` | Executes SQL business queries |
| `make run` | Runs Full Workflow (ETL + Queries) |

## ☁️ AWS Architecture (Production Proposal)

### Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Orchestration"
        SF[AWS Step Functions]
    end
    
    subgraph "Extract"
        S3[S3 Bucket]
        Lambda1[Lambda S3 Trigger]
    end
    
    subgraph "Transform"
        Glue[AWS Glue Job]
    end
    
    subgraph "Load"
        RDS[RDS PostgreSQL]
    end
    
    S3 -->|PUT Event| Lambda1
    Lambda1 -->|Start| SF
    SF -->|Execute| Glue
    Glue -->|Load| RDS

```

### Stack Justification

* **S3 + Lambda:** Event-driven ingestion.
* **AWS Glue:** Scalable serverless Spark/Python environment.
* **RDS:** Fully managed relational database.
* **CloudWatch:** Centralized observability for logs and failures.

## 📊 Business Queries

Once the ETL is finished, the following are automatically executed:

1. **🏆 Ranking:** Doctor with the highest number of confirmed appointments.
2. **👤 Specific Patient:** Confirmed history for patient #34.
3. **❌ Loss Analysis:** Cancelled appointments during the 2021-2024 period.
4. **📈 KPI:** Confirmation ratio by medical specialty.

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Idempotency:**  can run the pipeline multiple times; the final result will always be consistent.

✅ **Audit Logging:** Every discarded record has a "reason" documented in the log file.

✅ **Cloud-Ready Architecture:** Designed for easy migration to AWS Glue and RDS.

## 🏗️ AWS Glue Deployment

### 1. Build the Package
Pack the code into an `.egg` file for Glue:
```bash
make build-glue
```

### 2. Upload to S3
Upload the following files to your bucket:
- `src/dist/*.egg` -> `s3://bucket/lib/`
- `glue_job/glue_etl.py` -> `s3://bucket/scripts/`
- `data/raw/*.xlsx` -> `s3://bucket/data/`

### 3. Run Glue Job
Use the `Python Shell` with minimal configuration. Pass `DOCTORS_INPUT`, `APPOINTMENTS_INPUT`, and DB credentials as Job Arguments.

### 4. Local Testing
You can test the Glue logic locally (mocked):
```bash
./venv/bin/python tests/test_glue_local.py
```
